# Code Refactor and Testing

## Introduction

This repository contains a refactor of the given PHP codebase along with optional unit tests. The goal of this exercise is to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability while optionally adding unit tests to ensure the correctness of the code.

## Thoughts on the Original Code

### Positive Aspects
- **Functionality**: The code is functional and covers a broad range of requirements for a booking system, including job management, notifications, and user interactions.
- **Comprehensive**: The repository and controller methods address various scenarios and provide extensive handling for different booking states and user roles.

### Areas for Improvement
The original code provided in `BookingController.php` and `BookingRepository.php` has several areas that can be improved:

- **Structure and Organization**: The code lacks a clear separation of concerns, with business logic mixed in the controller and repository.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Some methods had multiple responsibilities, making the code harder to maintain and test.
- **Repetition**: There are repetitive patterns that can be abstracted to reduce redundancy.
- **Dependency Injection**: While some dependencies were injected, the usage was inconsistent.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling is inconsistent and can be improved for better robustness.
- **Readability**: The code can benefit from better variable naming, consistent formatting, and inline comments for clarity.

## Refactoring Approach

### General Improvements
The refactored code aims to address these issues by:

- **Improving Structure**: Separating business logic from the controller into service classes where appropriate.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Split methods with multiple responsibilities into smaller, more focused methods.
- **Reducing Repetition**: Abstracting repetitive code into reusable methods.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilize dependency injection to manage dependencies, making the code more testable and maintainable.
- **Enhancing Readability**: Using meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling to improve code reliability and readability.

### How I Would Have Done It

#### Use of Service Layer
Introduce a service layer to handle business logic, keeping controllers thin.

#### BookingController
- Moved business logic to a new `BookingService` class, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Ensured consistent response handling using `response()->json()`.

#### BookingRepository
- Centralized the use of the `Job` model using the inherited `$model` property.
- Introduced smaller methods to handle specific tasks, improving readability and maintainability.

#### BaseService and Contracts
- Created a `BaseService` class to standardize common service functionalities.
- Defined interfaces for services and repositories to enforce contracts and improve code flexibility.

### Refactoring Changes

#### BookingController.php
- Extracted business logic into a service class.
- Simplified methods to improve readability.
- Improved error handling and input validation.

#### BookingRepository.php
- Reduced redundancy by abstracting repetitive code.
- Improved method organization and readability.
- Added comments to clarify complex logic.

### New Classes and Architecture
- Implemented interfaces and followed proper design patterns.

### Unit Tests
Add unit tests to cover critical parts of the code, ensuring functionality is as expected.

#### Tests

#### TeHelper::willExpireAt
- Verified the method's behavior for different due times and created_at timestamps.
- Ensured correct expiration times based on the given logic.

#### UserRepository::createOrUpdate
- Tested both creation and update scenarios.
- Verified proper handling of user meta and blacklist updates.

## Conclusion
The refactored code is more modular, maintainable, and testable. By adhering to SOLID principles, we have improved the overall structure and readability of the code. The addition of tests ensures that the critical functionalities are verified, providing a reliable foundation for future development.

To run the tests, you will need the `phpunit/phpunit` library.
